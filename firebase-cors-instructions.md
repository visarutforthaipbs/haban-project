```bash
firebase use haban-pics
```

4. Upload the CORS configuration:

```bash
gsutil cors set firebase-cors.json gs://haban-pics.firebasestorage.app
```

## Option 2: Using Google Cloud Console

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Storage â†’ Browser
3. Find your bucket `haban-pics.firebasestorage.app`
4. Click on "Bucket Settings" tab
5. Scroll down to the CORS configuration section
